# Fundamental Skills

## Mental Math

A good way to practice your basic arithmetic skills is to visit [zetamac](https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/), which
prompts you simple math problems quickly. Your goal is to answer as many problems as you can quickly. Notice that
because they don't penalize you for inputting wrong answers, try to not guess your answers.

One thing I hope you notice is that as you try to get faster at these simple math problems, you will start noticing
tricks. Of course, you can just search how to do certain tricks, e.g. what the *11 trick is or how to add something
in the form of 97 + 45 = (100 - 3) + 45 = 143, but I would highly recommend trying to figure out what tricks
work for _you_. If you find that you aren't improving anymore, maybe then it might be worth to search up some
arithmetic tricks.

The following table should give a sense of where you are. This is based off of a 120 second test, with default settings on.

| Score | Comments |
|-------|:---------|
|0-9    |You can do a lot better    |
|10-15  |Below average              |
|15-24  |Average                    |
|25-35  |Above average              |
|35-44  |Pretty good                |
|45+    |Should be set for anything |

## Number Sense

Number sense is about being able to understand properties about numbers to do computation faster
and be able to estimate difficult calculations fairly accurately. A good example of
what number sense is about can be found at [AGMath](https://www.agmath.com/57427/index.html),
an ancient website for sure, but if you scroll down to the bottom of this page you can find
number sense worksheets. I think number sense is a natural extension from the simple arithmetic
you can practice from zetamac.
