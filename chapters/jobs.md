# Finding a Job

Many people with technical majors have a goal of immediately entering industry
and aiming to make the big bucks. At a school like Carnegie Mellon University,
students are presented with many jobs, thanks to the reputation of the school.
To optimize your job finding experience, this chapter presents useful tools for
you to use while looking for your job, and provides
[links to guides on pursuing certain careers](#resources-for-different-career-paths).

## Tools

You should have the following tools to make your job search more efficient:

- [Job Application Tracker](#job-application-tracker)
- [Common Questions](#common-questions)
- [Leetcode Problems](#leetcode-problems)
- [Interview Reflections](#interview-reflections)
- [Free Times](#free-times)

### Job Application Tracker

You are likely to apply to a lot of jobs, so it is paramount to be able to
efficiently track the progress of all your job applications.

The table below is an example of a spreadsheet template you can use to keep track of your applications:

| Company  | Applied  | 1 | 2 | 3 | Result| Salary | Bonus | RSU | Travel |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CompanyX  | SWE, www.compx.io  | Comments | ... | ... | Offer/No Offer | 100k | 10k | 60k/4 yrs| 10k |
| CompanyY | SWE, \<Link\>  | ... | ... | ... | Offer/No Offer | 90k | 15k | 80k/4 yrs| 5k |

- **Company**: Name of company
- **Applied**: position applied to at the company, with link to status of application/place to apply. I color this cell
  - red if I intend to apply, but do not have the link yet
  - yellow if I have the link, but have not submitted my application yet
  - green if I have submitted
- **1/2/3/...**: Round numbers for the interview process. I put my reflections in these cells. They are short reflections, and are meant for reviewing if there were impressions/tips to take away from the interview.
- **Result**: Did you get the job or not?
- **Salary**: Base salary
- **Bonus**: Sign-on bonus.
- **RSU**: Restricted stock units. Usually only given out at big companies. (fulltime)
- **Travel**: Travel and relocation package (fulltime)

Keeping a table can help you be more aware of where you are in the process for many interviews, and also help you organize your offers once you get them, which can be useful for offer negotiations.

### Common Questions

Behavioral questions can be quite annoying during technical interviews,
but they can often be the differentiator between similarly-skilled candidates.
Therefore, it is very important to prepare for behavioral questions.
While it is reasonable to just prepare a few responses before an interview, making a **bank of behavioral questions** can be easier to
manage and review before interviews.

This document can also include common application questions, so that
applications and cover letters are easier to fill out. Notice that
some behavioral and application questions may overlap.

**Common Behavioral Questions:**

- Why SF/NYC/Chicago/[city]? This question wants to know why you would like
  to work in a particular city
- What is a setback you've had?
- What is your proudest achievement?
- What is your greatest weakness?
- Why do you like to do [hobby]?
- What's a risky decision you've made in your life?
- How do you work with others?

**Common Application Questions:**

- Why do you want to be a software developer?
- Describe an accomplishment you are proud of
- What inspires you to connect, empower, and create?
- What do you think is the next big thing in tech?

### Leetcode Problems

Sort all the leetcode problems you have done according to topic/company tag/difficulty, 
especially the problems that you cannot solve on your own. Go over every topics before your 
interview, pay more attention to the problems that were tagged the company you are interviewing with. 
With huge firms like the FLAG, this might not be super useful, but another thing you can 
always do is to search more recent interview reflections online written by other interviewees.

Some good sites for this include:

- <https://www.glassdoor.com/index.html>
- <https://www.quora.com>

### Interview Reflections

After your interviews, you should reflect on how you did.
This is especially useful when you first start interviewing,
but once you get used to it, you don't have to write all your
reflections down on paper.

I keep a folder of my interview reflections, and add a new doc every
time I have an interview. Each doc consists of

- Mistakes you made, how you can do better
- Questions you were asked, behavioral and technical
- What you did well on
- How you felt about your performance and if you think you will get the offer

### Free Times

You are often going to be asked what available times you have for interviews.
You can obviously just look at your schedule and figure it out every time,
but this is time consuming and you are better off making a list of your available
time slots in a spreadsheet, so you can copy it to interviewers to more quickly
set up your interview times.

Below is an example of a spreadsheet you can make for your free times:

| Date | Time (Your time zone)  | Time2 (time zone 2) |
|---|---|---|
| 21-Oct  | before 12 PM, after 3 PM  | after 12 PM |
| 22-Oct  | 12 PM - EOD | 9 AM - EOD |
| 23-Oct  | 10:30 AM - 12PM | N/A|

If you desire, you can write a script to automatically convert from your
time zone to another time zone. The only issue is that students are generally
very free, which means you are ok taking interviews in your 8 PM time zone, which is too late for your time zone but might be 5 PM in another time zone which is reasonable. For this reason, I just fill out other time zones manually, but with some work a script can be written to automatically generate more free times.
