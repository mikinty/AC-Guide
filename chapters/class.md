# Conquering Classes

One of the most important parts of taking on a technical major at CMU
is proving that you've learned from your classes by earning goods grades.
Of course, many people say that grades don't *really*, matter, but come on,
a student with a 3.9 GPA is going to get a ton more job offers and eyes than
someone with a 3.4 GPA with slightly better projects. Unless you go all-in
on your extracurriculars, your GPA is going to carry a heavy weight.

Despite the pressure to get good grades, the good news is that you can
usually get good grades if you put enough effort, and in a smart way.
I know that sounds obvious, but the worst case is if a class is just too
hard and requires talent.

Below, we illustrate some ways to do well in your classes, with tools to
help you keep on track.

## Pre-studying a class

Skim over lecture slides

Look/do the homework

Read the textbook

Work on skills that will help you ace the class.

## Grade Tracker

You often hear that classes shouldn't be about your grades, which is fine
to live by, but if you want to realistically do well in a class and get the
grade you want, you have to put effort in tracking your grade.

A grade tracker can look like the following:

| Item  | Points  | Total | Grade | Weight | Scale | LOSS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HW1 | 71 | 80 | 89% | 0.05 | 0.0444 |  |
| HW2 | 79 | 80 | 99% | 0.05 | 0.0494 | |
| HW3 | 79 | 80 | 99% | 0.05 | 0.0494 | |
| HW4 | 57 | 80 | 72% | 0.05 | 0.0356 | **-0.014375**|
| | | | | 0.2 | |
| Lab 1 | 45 | 50 | 90% | 0.1 | 0.09 | |
| Lab 2 | 49 | 50 | 98% | 0.1 | 0.098 | |
| Lab 3 | 47 | 50 | 94% | 0.1 | 0.094 | |
| | | | | 0.3 | |
| Midterm| 87 | 100 | 87% | 0.2 | 0.174 | **-0.026**|
|Final| | 100 | 87% | 0.3 |  | |
|Min Final A| 88.4 |  | |  | | |
|Min Final B| 55.07 |  | |  | | |
|Min Final C| 21.73 |  | |  | | |
| **TOTAL** |    |  | |  | 0.6348 | |

A spreadsheet like this is useful because you can use it to see what assignments are important, where you lost points, and how to make target goals for assignments or final exams. In the above spreadsheet, the targets for the final exam grades to earn a particular grade are very clear, and this can help you make a game plan for how you study this class.

For example, in the spreadsheet above you can see the **LOSS** column shows where I lost points on assignments, to remind myself what is important and where not to make mistakes again. I also only write losses for the bigger losses, so for example losing 2.6% of my grade on the midterm would remind me that exams are important for getting a good grade in the class, and also that doing poorly on a homework could cost me 1.5% of my grade.
