# A Sample Curriculum

Given the many topics covered in this guide, it may be hard to construct a
set of sessions that naturally teaches all of the concepts without jumping
around too much. The following is a proposed curriculum that can be used
with technically-inclined AC clients.

Weekly breakdown:

1. **Mental Math / Basics:**
   - Take a zetamac mental math test and record the student's score.
     The student should aim to eventually have a score of >= 30
   - Introduce number sense if it might be useful.
   - Ask how the student feels about his/her classes, and recommend
     resources, such as textbooks, websites, worksheets, that can supplement
     the student's current learning experience.

2. **Programming setup:**
   - Ask about the current student programming setup.
     If there are inefficiencies, point them out. Explain why an efficient programming
     setup can dramatically increase efficiency while working.
   - Introduce some efficient programming setups. (See the [programming chapter](./programming.md))
