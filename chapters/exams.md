# Exam Prep

Unfortunately, no matter how much you feel like you're learning, if you don't do
well on exams, your GPA will likely not reflect that. Although it might seem obvious,
in order to do well on exams, you have to treat them as a big event. Think of them as
a race day swim event, a performance at a recital, etc...

With that in mind, let's go over some ways to prepare for your big academic days.

## Study Plan

As with any undertaking, you should have some sort of idea of what you're going to
do in order to prepare for your exam. The main purpose of a study plan is to
block out time so you can give yourself schedule space to focus on studying
for your exam, instead of getting distracted and drifting off into doing other things. Something I like to do is create a "master study plan," which is a study plan that I would do if I had infinite amount of time to study. The idea is very similar to [the section below about study materials](##potpurri-of-materials), where you want to give yourself an idea of all that is possible to study. An example of such a plan may look something like

- Read all textbook chapters relating to the exam
- Read all lecture notes
- Redo all HWs
- Do the practice exam
- Look at notes from courses from other schools
- Do the exams from other courses
- Read about related topics that are tested

Since your plan is bound to get messed up at some point, you should put priorities on
certain parts of your study plan. Always review the most juicy and important materials first,
and then go with the rest of the schedule if you have time.

For example, if you feel that ideally you should read all your lectures
before attempting a practice exam, but you only have a few hours left.
The practice exam is probably going to benefit you a lot more; do that first.

## Potpurri of Materials

When you're studying, you should try to find as much stuff to study as possible. The idea is that you should never feel like there is not enough to study.
You'll feel more motivated, you'll have more things to look at, and you'll be able to choose the material you find more useful. Some places you can look at for help are

- Class materials
  - HW
  - Past exams
  - Notes from lecture and recitation
- Textbook
- Courses from other schools
  - HW, past exams, notes
- Academic competitions, like olympiads. E.g. for math, you can look at International Math Olympiad problems if they are applicable.

  - Wikipedia
  - Science articles

## Sprints

To prepare for the exam taking itself, you need to go through the motions. Doing **sprints** are often useful to help you prepare your strategy, figure out the motions, and get a feel for the exam day pressure. The idea of a sprint is you take a practice exam, and take it faster than the time you'll be given on exam day. So for example, if you have an 80-minute exam, you can consider forcing yourself to do it in 60 minutes.

What you usually learn from sprints is

- How to work under time pressure
- How to prioritize what's important
- Speed reading, understanding the format of the exam
- Finding out where your weaknesses are
- Building a strategy for how to approach the exam efficiently
- Think faster, giving yourself more time on the actual exam

## Survival Kit

On exam day, you should not feel uncomfortable about any aspect of the exam that you can prepare for.
For example,

- Is the room too cold? Bring a jacket.
- Are the desks uncomfortable? Figure out a configuration that works for you.
- Are you going to get thirsty or hungry? Bring water and snacks.
- Will you probably need to pee in the middle of the exam? Plan out when you want to take a bathroom break.
- Do you need to erase things on your exam? Eraser.
- Will you need to draw straight lines on your exam? Ruler.
- Calculator runs out of battery? Bring your AAAs.
- Does the course staff not provide enough paper? Bring scratch paper.

There are lots of scenarios that you can come up with. Over time, you'll naturally face scenarios where
you wish you had something. To make the best out of these past experiences, starting building your
**survival kit**, which is basically list of things you bring to every exam. You can think of it as hiking
gear almost, but for exams. The above scenarios already give an idea of what mine looks like, but to list
out some of the things I bring:

- 2 pencils (mechanical, with lead refills), 2 pens (gel), eraser, scratch paper
- Watch, Ruler, calculator (if permitted, with batteries)
- Water bottle with water, 2-3 granola bars, chocolate, gum (if I start falling asleep)
- Hoodie, extra shirt (in case legs get cold), headphones (if it is loud, sometimes not permitted to wear in exams but I got to use it once when there was construction outside)

## Reflections

After your exam is taken, you should do a reflection. The idea is that you can identify your strengths and weaknesses, and also develop strategies that you can use on future exams. For example, if you found out that you did very poorly on assembly questions on a systems exam, then you should practice reading assembly, and then you can do better on the next exam.

You may benefit from keeping all your exam reflections in one place, so you can review certain exams you took if needed.
