# Guide for Technical Academic Coaches

We are part of the Academic Development group at Carnegie Mellon University,
where we help students with their academic lives. Unlike class tutoring, we focus
on more general skills like time management and study skills.

As technical majors, Academic Coaching can often feel ineffective, because
technical classes are often hard not because you can't manage your time
properly, but because there is content you don't know. This guide is will
discuss several training-like techniques to build skills that are useful
for learning technical classes more effectively and compile links to 
materials that can be useful during study.
